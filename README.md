This Python application is a Personal Expense Tracker that uses SQLite for data storage, Tkinter for the graphical user interface (GUI), and Matplotlib for visualizing financial data (like expenses).
Users can:
Register or log in securely
Add and view financial transactions (categorized as income or expense)
Set savings goals and track progress
Set budgets for spending categories and receive alerts when exceeded
Visualize expenses using bar and pie charts
It stores user accounts, transactions, savings goals, and category budgets in a local SQLite database (finance_tracker.db).
The app is organized into a class-based structure and provides an intuitive interface for managing personal finances.
